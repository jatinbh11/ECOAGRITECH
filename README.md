# ECOAGRITECH 🌿
A simple ML and DL-based website that recommends the best crop to grow, fertilizers to use, and identifies diseases affecting your crops.

## DISCLAIMER ⚠️
This is a Proof of Concept (POC) project. The data used in this project comes without any guarantee from the creator. Users are advised not to rely on this system for making actual farming decisions. The creator is not responsible for any outcomes resulting from such use. However, this project showcases how Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) can be applied to precision farming if developed at a larger scale using authentic and verified data.

## MOTIVATION 💪

- Agriculture is a major sector that influences a country’s economic growth.
- In countries like India, a significant portion of the population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. By integrating advanced technologies such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning into agriculture, farmers can increase their yield and simplify the farming process.

This project implements the following applications:

1. **Crop Recommendation**:
   - Users provide soil data to receive predictions for the best crop to grow.

2. **Fertilizer Recommendation**:
   - Users input soil data and the type of crop they are growing to get recommendations on soil improvements, including addressing deficiencies or excesses.

3. **Plant Disease Prediction**:
   - Users upload an image of a diseased plant leaf to get predictions about the disease. The application also provides background information and suggestions for curing the disease.
